# Pull Request Checkstyle

Pull Request Checkstyle is a simple Github action that helps to set up some styling rules for the PR commit messages and branch names and identify their violation during CI runtime.

# Usage
```yaml
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SOME_TOKEN }}
    steps:
    - name: "Check branch name and commit messages style"
      uses: maximbircu/github-action-pull-request-checkstyle@v1.0.0
      with:
        commit-message-title-regex: ".*"     # Commit message title regex (Note that it validates just the first line of the commit message)
        commit-message-title-min-length: 20  # Commit message title min length (Note that it validates just the first line of the commit message)
        commit-message-title-max-length: 72  # Commit message title max length (Note that it validates just the first line of the commit message)

        branch-name-regex: ".*"        # Branch name regex
        branch-name-min-length: 20     # Branch name min length
        branch-name-max-length: 72     # Branch name max length
```

# Contribution rules:
1. Make sure there is a GitHub issue describing the changes you want to contribute with. (Add one if needed)
2. Submit a PR just in case you:
- Fixed the bug or implement the new feature properly;
- Covered all code with unit tests;
- Updated the changelog file;
- Updated the documentation (If needed);
